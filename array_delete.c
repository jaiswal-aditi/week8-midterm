III. BONUS - Deletion of an element of an array (20 points)

Write a C program that allows a user to delete an element from a specified position in an array.
The program should first prompt the user to enter the size of the array and then input elements in
ascending order. The user should then provide the position of the element to be deleted, and the
program should update the array accordingly by shifting elements to the left. Finally, the program
should display the modified array.

Example of Input and Output:

Input:
Input the size of the array: 5
Input 5 elements in the array in ascending order:
element at index 0: 10
element at index 1: 20
element at index 2: 30
element at index 3: 40
element at index 4: 50
Input the position of the element to delete: 3

Output:
The new list is: 10 20 40 50
