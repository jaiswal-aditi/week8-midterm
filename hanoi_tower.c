IV. BONUS - Tower of Hanoi (35 points)

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks of
different sizes which can slide onto any rods (see diagram in the pdf).

The puzzle starts with the disks in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.
The objective of the puzzle is to move all disks from the source rod to the destination rod while following the rules below:
• Only one disk can be moved at a time.
• Each move consists of taking the top disk from one of rod and placing it on another rod (i.e., a disk can only be moved if it is the top disk on a rod.).
• No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Sample Inputs/Outputs:

Enter the number of disks: 3
Solution for Tower of Hanoi with 3 disks:
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 2 from rod A to rod B
Move disk 1 from rod C to rod B
Move disk 3 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod B to rod A
Move disk 2 from rod B to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C
