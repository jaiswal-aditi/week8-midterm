### Instructions:
- Update the program files following instructions provided in MidTerm_Wednesday_March_5th_Week8.pdf (uploaded on Laulima) and in the program comments.

**NOTE**: 
- Github is not a place to test your code. Test it on your machines first. You are only allowed to commit once otherwise your grade will be penalized. Autograding is disabled for this midterm.

### Steps to submit changes:
1. Click on desired .c to open file
2. Click the pencil icon to edit file on the top right
3. Update the file with your code following assignment description
4. Once you are ready to submit your changes, click on the green "Commit changes..." button on the top right
5. Enter a commit message that describes your changes in a few words - eg: added printf statement
6. Select "Commit directly to the main branch"
7. Click on "Commit Changes" button. Your code changes have been submitted!



### Note:
We strongly recommend you run your finished programs on your local machine/laptop first to test if they are working correctly, and then copy the finished code to github. 

Make sure you have your final submission in before the deadline has passed.

You will not be able to submit changes after the deadline has passed.

For any questions, please reach out to Dr. Katy Tarrit (katytm7@hawaii.edu) AND Aditi Jaiswal (ajaiswal@hawaii.edu)
